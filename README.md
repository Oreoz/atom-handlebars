## Installation

Right click on the Atom Application and select Show Package Contents. Navigate to Contents/Resources/app and add the following to the package dependencies section:

	"atom-handlebars": "0.1.1",

Then, in Terminal, cd to that same app directory and run:

	npm install atom-handlebars

Restart Atom and open your preferences. If all went well you should see Atom Handlebars in the left section of the preferences pane.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
